# Learn Model Context Protocol (MCP)

This repository is a sandbox for learning and experimenting with the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. It contains personal explorations into:

- Secure token validation and authorization workflows
- Role and scope-based access controls
- Local LLM integration using tools like LM Studio
- No-token-passthrough policy enforcement
- Modular, testable tool orchestration

These experiments are part of an ongoing effort to understand how modern LLM systems can be built responsibly, securely, and with clear trust boundaries.
